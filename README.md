# 👋 Hi, I’m @webdevmentor
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching junior developers the basics of web development, <br>
  so they don't have to spend years over years to build their dream app/website.
- 👨‍💻 I started a new job as C# developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about CI and automation with GitHub actions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on personal projects which are entangled in spaghetti code.
- 📫 You can reach me here [@GitHub](https://github.com/webdevmentor) or [@webdevmentor.info](https://www.webdevmentor.info)
